# Covid-data-Visualization

This was my first project on powerBi so at first I find it difficult to navigate through options but after few hours of struggling I find it interesting and creative tool. So I used the covid-19 Data to make some visualization. I intend to explore this beautiful tool more so that my creativity in making dashboards will get better over time. I am still learning so whatever best I could create I did.
